<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Removes one or more values from the Path environment variable if they exist.
        Other values of the Path environment variable will not be modified. In this
        example, C:\test456 and C:\test123 will be removed, but all other Path entries
        would be left intact. Ensure that Path is set to $true in order to append/remove
        values and not completely replace the Path environment variable.
